# Duncan Steward's GitHub
Hello!

Welcome to my Github. This is a collection of all if not most of the projects that I have done in my collegiate career as UMBC undergraduate student. I am not very well-versed in Github, but I will be sure to keep this as up-to-date and as clean as I can make it during free time. Each project I have listed here will have a README which will include a short summary of what the project was and what it's purpose was for and why. If you have any further questions, please email me at steward2@umbc.edu. Thank you!
