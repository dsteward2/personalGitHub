# Duncan Steward's GitHub
  Hello!

  Welcome to my Github. This is a collection of all if not most of the projects that I have done in my collegiate career as UMBC undergraduate student. I am not very well-versed in Github, but I will be sure to keep this as up-to-date and as clean as I can make it during free time. Each project I have listed here will have a README which will include a short summary of what the project was and what it's purpose was for and why (note: I will be doing this for what I feel are important projects, not so much as the smaller homeworks or even some smaller projects). If you have any further questions, please email me at steward2@umbc.edu. Thank you!

# STATUS
  - [ ] Working on adding projects
  - [ ] Cleaning up files
  - [ ] Providing READMEs

# NOTE
  Some projects may not be in their once completed form as I no longer have access to older classes where I could obtain the actual code that was handed in for grading. Others were not completed on purpose or contain mistakes, but the purpose is to show experience, mainly.
